1.Parent and child process 
Write a C/CPP program to create a child process. 
Child should print its pid and its parent’s pid and should exit by printing message as “Child Exiting …”. 
Parent should print its pid and should exit by printing message as “Parent Exiting ..”. 
(Hint(functions to be used) : getpid, fork, getppid) 

->#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<sys/types.h>
#include<unistd.h>

int main() {                                                                                                            
pid_t pid;

        pid = fork();
        if(pid ==0) {
                printf("child process- pid %d, ppid %d \n", getpid(), getppid());
                printf("Child Exiting … \n"); }
        else if(pid > 0) {
                printf("parent process- pid %d, ppid %d \n", getpid(), getppid());
                printf("Parent Exiting .. \n"); }
        else {
                printf("Error creating new process through fork() \n");

                exit(0);

2)Scheduling functions 
Write a program in C/CPP to check the scheduling policy used by the process and its priority. 
(Hint(functions to be used) : sched_getscheduler, getpid) 

->#include<iostream>
#include<unistd.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<sched.h>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
        int a;
        a=sched_getscheduler(getpid());
        switch(a)
        {
                case SCHED_OTHER:cout<<"another scheduling poly"<<endl;
                break;
                case SCHED_RR:cout<<"round robin scheduler"<<endl;
                break;
                case SCHED_FIFO:cout<<"first in first out"<<endl;
                break;

        }
return 0;
}
OUTPUT:
another scheduling policy

3)Scheduling functions 
Write a program in C/CPP to get the current scheduling policy of the process. 
The program should change the scheduling policy to the other than current one. 
Program should report errors if it fails to set the new scheduling policy. 
(Hint(functions to be used) : sched_setscheduler, getpid) 

->#include<iostream>
#include<unistd.h>
#include<sched.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
        int a;
        a=sched_setscheduler(getpid(),SCHED_FIFO,0);

        if(a==0)
        {
                cout<<"priority set";
        }
        else
        {
                cout<<"priority not set";
        }
return 0;
}
OUTPUT:
priority not set

4)Scheduling algorithm 
Write a program in C/CPP to take process name, its arrival time and execution/burst time as input. 
Use FCFS(non-preemptive) algorithm to calculate wait time of each process, average 
wait time, turnaround time of each process and average turnaround time. 
Calculation of time will start from the arrival time of first process.
execution/burst time - Time required for execution of process
	Wait time of process = response time of process - arrival time process
	Response time of process : time at which process is scheduled to run
	Average wait time = (sum of wait time of each process) / (number of processes) 
	Turnaround time of process = (finish/completion time of process) - (arrival time of process)
	Average turnaround time = (sum of turnaround time of each process) / (number of processes) 

Sample Input 
			     
Process	arrival time	 execution/burst time
P1	0	3
P2	2	5
P3	5	6

Sample Output 
Process	Response time	Completion/finish time	Waiting time	Avg waiting time	Turnaround time	Avg turnaround time
P1	0	3	0-0 = 0	(0+1+3)/3=4/3	3-0=3	(3+6+9)/3=18/3=6
P2	3	8	3-2=1		8-2=6	
P3	8	14	8-5=3		14-5=9
